# LRU-Cache
Alright! Imagine you have a tiny toy box 🎁 that can only hold **3 toys** 🧸🚗🦖 at a time.  

But you have **lots** of toys! 🎠🎈🐻🎯  

Every time you want to play with a **new toy** 🏀, but your box is **full**, you have to **remove** one toy to make space.  

You decide to always remove the **toy you played with the longest time ago** ⏳ because you don’t care about it as much anymore.  

This is how an **LRU Cache (Least Recently Used Cache)** works! 🧠💡 It remembers the **most recent things you used** and **removes the oldest ones**
when it runs out of space. That way, your favorite toys (or most-used items) are always easy to grab! 🎉
